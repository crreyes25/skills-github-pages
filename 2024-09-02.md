**tl;dr:** Golbez does a lot of damage with [team buffs](https://gfycat.com/KindheartedForkedGonolek) and [solo](https://gfycat.com/IdioticSourAfricanelephant). Also, here’s Golbez [wacking](https://gfycat.com/AcrobaticWelcomeKillerwhale) Ifrit if you’re into that. 

***

**Introduction**: 

Golbez is my *absolute* favorite character in the Final Fantasy universe, period. He is a *massive mage* in armor that uses both melee and magic attacks at the same time (The After Years and Dissidia). This “jack-of-all-trades” appearance was appealing to me, and thus I stuck with him whenever possible.

Now, onto a quick preview of his kit, his first two skills are a **mix of melee and magic attacks** not unlike Prishe, and his EX, Twin Meteor, is purely magic with everything being dark elemental. 

He **must** upkeep stacks of his unique buff, *Shadow Dragon*, so that he can deal damage with follow-ups (analogous to Red Spiral > White Out combo by Vaan).

Also, with a quick and intrusive spoiler alert, you **NEED** his EX weapon to upkeep Shadow Dragon stacks without downtime because his first two skills do not refresh Shadow Dragon’s duration. Else, the buff will wear out, and thus, you’ll be back to square ~~one~~ zero. This will be explained in greater detail further on.


Twin Meteor also includes **Dark Imperil** which decreases the tier of an enemies’ resistance which offers party utility for dark elemental users (Dark Knight Cecil, Leon, Shantotto, Relm-Diabolos). 


With all of this in mind, I wish to present Golbez’ kit as a fan and someone who tested him extensively to see where he works and how he performs.

**Skills**: 


*Disclaimer: Having his 15/35cp is necessary as they increase Shadow Dragon Stacks by a marginal amount and the potency of their respective skill. Also, every skill is Dark Elemental, so I won’t include it within each reiteration of his skill.*


**Shadow Dragon**: I / II / III increase own ATK & mBRV by 10% / 20% / 30%.	

											
**BRV Attack +**: 1 Dark Magic Single target BRV Attack + 1 Dark Melee single target BRV Attack. Has a coefficient of 80% + 40% = 120%. Great filler especially in launch comps.


**Rising Wave**: 1-Hit Melee BRV + 1-Hit Magic BRV to HP. Grants II stacks for 4 turns (with 15CP passive) of Shadow Dragon. This attack is entirely single target and has a potency of 100%+100%. Self-buffs 40% mBRV. Overflows up to 120% mBRV.



**Rising Wave +**  (Shadow Dragon II): 1-Hit Melee BRV + 1-Hit Magic BRV to HP with a 1-Hit BRV Melee follow up from Golbez’ Shadow Dragon. Grants II stacks of Shadow Dragon for 4 turns (caps at III). It has a potency of (100%+100%)+120%=320%. Overflows up to 120% mBRV.



**Rising Wave ++** (Shadow Dragon III): 2-hit Melee BRV & 2-hit Magic BRV into HP hit with a 2-Hit Melee BRV + HP follow up. It has a potency of (60% x 2 + 60% x 2) + 100% x 2 = 440%. Overflows up to 120% mBRV. Does not refresh Shadow Dragon stacks.


*Rising Wave has a total of six uses.*


**Glare Hand**: 1-Hit Melee AOE BRV + 1-Hit Magic AOE BRV to HP. Grants II Shadow Dragon stacks (with 35CP passive) of Shadow Dragon for 4 turns. Glare Hand has a coefficient of 70%+70%. Self buffs 40% ATK.


**Glare Hand +** (Shadow Dragon II): 1-Hit Melee AOE BRV + 1-Hit Magic AOE BRV to AOE HP with a follow-up of 1-hit Melee AOE BRV+HP AOE. Grants II stacks of Shadow Dragon for 4 turns. (Caps at III as a friendly reminder).  The coefficient is  (70%+70%)+80%= 220%.


**Glare Hand ++** (Shadow Dragon III): 2-Hit Melee AOE BRV + 2-Hit Magic AOE BRV to AOE HP with a follow-up of 2-hit Melee AOE BRV+HP AOE. Does not refresh Shadow Dragon stacks. The coefficient is (40 % X 4)+ 60% x 2 = 280%.


*Glare Hand has a total of six uses.*


*This skill also benefits from the 1.6x multiplier on single targets.*


***PSA and Friendly Reminder: These skills at ++ do not refresh Shadow Dragon stacks, and the skill will run out and square-zero happens.***

**Twin Meteor**: 5 Dark Magic AOE BRV Attack + AOE HP dmg with a follow up of 5 Dark Magic AOE BRV Attack + AOE HP dmg. It inflicts Dark Imperil on the first meteor. Twin Meteor’s damage is increased by 1.6x modifier on Single target (like Glare Hand). It has 200% mBRV overflow. The coefficient is 30% x 5 + 50% x 5 = 400%. 


***Also, the most important function of Twin Meteor: Grants III stacks of Shadow Dragon for 6 turns.***
***
***tl;dr on Shadow Dragon Stacks: You lose a lot of damage if you miss his EX. You need his EX to make Golbez functionable because you lose two uses of a 440% coefficient skill.***
***

**Coefficient Comparisons:**


As it stands, Golbez has the highest damage coefficient (excluding EX skills) with Rising Wave ++ with a 440% coefficient.
Disclaimer: Tifa has Kiai and Fever Time buffs alongside Quistis’ Debuff Boost Aura, while Golbez only has Ifrit’s 25% ATK and his 40% ATK buff. 
Let’s compare this to Tifa’s Beat Rush w/Fever Time coefficient (360%):


[Golbez](https://gfycat.com/DemandingOblongAlaskankleekai)  vs. [Tifa](https://gfycat.com/PerkyUntimelyDragon)

*(Damage(Golbez)– iBRV – Break Bonus/3 + Damage(Dragon follow-up)) formula for Golbez' damage on the following gif*



(16290-2302-5310/3+11377)= 23595 (Golbez) vs. 6667*3=20,001 (Tifa)

 **23,595 Golbez** vs. **20,001 Tifa**


Even without Golbez completely criting compared to Tifa’s triple crit and outside buffs, Golbez outdpses her by a considerable margin considering the above parameters.
Keep in mind, Golbez is able to inflict Dark Imperil to further increase his damage which brings us to…

**Elemental and Weapon Type Interaction**:







Total Damage = Skill Power x ((ATK x ATK boost x 2/3) - (DEF x DEF boost x 2/9)) x (BRV DMG Reduction) x (BRV DMG Dealt Multiplier) x (**BRV DMG Increase Multiplier**) x (Critical Damage) x (RNG)


BRV DMG Increase = ( **Element Weak** ) x ( **Weapon Type. Weak** ) x (Target R. Weak ) x ( Same Element Enhance ) x (others) 

*This section has a hard cap of 250%.*



With the above formulae in mind ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/DissidiaFFOO/comments/7xeiyx/dffoo_damage_formula/)), we will be looking at the Damage increase formula. Do note that both of these formulae are product based meaning that lower percentages will decrease damage substantially, and higher percentages will boost damage with greater magnitude.



Moving forward, Golbez’ kit is composed of both melee and magic and dark-elemental locked, it is important to have some understanding of the Damage increase multiplier formula and its correspondence with the overall damage formula, but I’ll minimalize it to reinforce said understanding.



This brings us to weaknesses, neutral, and resistance categories. While Weapon Type and Elemental weaknesses are on the same formula, they are different. Because of this, Weapon Type and Elemental weaknesses both effect each other based on what they are. Here are the stages that correspond to both weapon types and elements:


**The stages are as follows:**


1. Absorb (BRV Heal = 100% of BRV damage)
2. Nul (BRV Damage = 0%)
3. Ineffective (BRV Damage = 10%)
4. Resist (BRV Damage = 50%)
5. Normal (BRV Damage = 100%)
6. Weak (BRV Damage = 150%)



For a quick side note, Dark Imperil will decrease the resistance tier by one (In*effective > Resist, Resist > Neutral, Neutral > Weak*; there is **no** category after Weak for more info, please reference the [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/DissidiaFFOO/comments/7xeiyx/dffoo_damage_formula/)).


Now, let us use the DMG increase formula assuming all parameters, besides Elemental and Weapon Types, are 1.


These above situations will represent the various situations Golbez will face throughout fights, and I’ll quickly go over them:


1. Golbez’ Meteor with **85% damage decrease** with **Magic Ineffectiveness and Dark Weakness** (.1 X 1.5 = .15) will make meteor hit like a pebble. 
1. First two hits [Physical] of Rising Wave with **25% damage decrease** with **Physical Resist and Elemental Weak** (0.5 x 1.5 = 0.75)
1. Last Two hits of Rising Wave [Magic] [Excluding Dragon] with **125% damage increase** via **Weak Magic and Elemental** (1.5*1.5 =2.25) 
1. Golbez’ Meteor with a **50% damage increase** with **Weak Element and Neutral Magic** (1.0 X 1.5=1.5). This damage is great in general.
1. Golbez’ Meteor with a **50% damage decrease** with **Resistant Element and Neutral Magic** (0.5 X 1=0.5)



All of the above situations that are very applicable to Golbez due to his *dual weapon type* and *Dark Imperil* as it is important to have a rough idea of how much the damage will increase/decrease based on parameters.

***
**Brief Overview of Golbez’ weaknesses:**


1.	**Longetivity**. Golbez has low skill counts, a slow charging EX, and no HP+. While his BRV+ is potent, he still has to take an extra turn to HP attack. This follows up to:
2.	**Team dependency**. He generally needs a team to fill out extra holes in harder fights because Golbez is a pure DPS. Buffers, batteries, and especially launchers are his best friends.
3.	**EX dependent**. As stated above, his EX is the only way to recharge his Shadow Dragon Stacks. He loses 2 uses of 440% damage with 120% mBRV overflow in addition to losing Dark Imperil.

***

**Brief recap of why Golbez is EX dependent**:

1. In Golbez' 6th turn, he **will** run out of Shadow Dragon stacks. Golbez will be forced to use his 240/140 potency skills over 440/280 skills respectively.
1. Golbez **does not** have a 400% filler move to pace his **limited** moveset.
1. Golbez **will not** be able to participate in content that is **Dark Resistant** and other varieties without said filler move. Please re-read my **Elemental Type and Weakness Interaction** section  to further explain the reasoning behind *Dark Imperil's* importance.




***
**Conclusion**:


Golbez does a lot of damage and has a lot of interesting variety of options due to his dual weapon type and dark imperil. He might be dependent on a good party to build him up, but he is an attacker that will flourish under the right conditions. Despite my initial criticisms (dual weapon types and dark elemental lock) of my husbando, the math makes him work out on a variety of situations despite 90% physical resistance or 50% magic resistance. Overall, I’m very happy the way Golbez came out, and I can’t wait to use him in more content!


***



**Pros**: *High Damage, Dark Imperil, Decent against Physical-Ineffective enemies*. 



**Cons**: *Entirely EX reliant, team-dependent, sub-par longevity*.



***


**Videos**: 


Because Golbez is a fairly straight-forward character, I’ll only talk about Kefka’s LC100 fight as Golbez’ kit works best with him in that fight. I do recommend watching the Arc 2-1 Last node fights by myself, and by Vpower duo video (Kefka exploiting hp silence/blind, Golbez); these two runs are nice to compare each other with regardless.

 [Kefka LV100 LC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBObluVz04k) Dark Resist (50%) feat. Golbez, Rem, and Vanille


For a quick intro, the bosses are 50% Dark Resistant which means there’s a job for Twin Meteor! Upkeeping Dark Imperil is necessary so that Golbez can do optimal damage. While this fight can last a while, especially since I didn’t use a support to clear trash mobs from Wave 1-4, Rem and Vanille supports Golbez via battery, and allows him to pace his skills with ease.


2:24 Twin Meteor at start so I can deal damage.


3:53 Golbez is a tank. /s


5:28 Buffing mBRV  on support Golbez for higher Summon Burst instead of puling off two meteors within 5 support turns.


7:44 Golbez is actually a tank. /s

[Golbez EX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWUfzKv5tjU) event feat. Cait Sith, Golbez, and Quistis

tl;dr Just a lot of damage with a great party.
